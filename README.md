# Projectile motion simulation
Simple projectile motion simulation created using python and pygame

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to clone repo and create a virtual environment and install the required packages. Here are the steps:

1. **clone the repository"**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FluffyRudy/projectile-motion-simulation.git
```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository. Then, run the following command to create a new virtual environment:
This will create a new virtual environment named `venv`.
```bash
cd projectile-motion-simulation
python3 -m venv .env
```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

Depending on your operating system, activate virtual environment:
- **Linux/macOS:**

  ```
  source .env/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows:**

  ```
  .env\Scripts\activate
  ```

4. **Install the required packages:**

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the required packages by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Running the simulation:**

```bash
python3 main.py
```

6. **Handling Input:**

    - To enter the velocity value, click inside the input box.
    - Type the desired velocity value using the keyboard.
    - Press the Enter key to submit the velocity value.
    - Alternatively, you can click outside the input box to submit the velocity value.

7. **Accepting Data:**

    - make sure input is numbers(numeric) although program handle (ignores) alphabet its always good to be careful
    - The program accepts velocity input as numeric values entered via the keyboard.
    - Pressing the Enter key or clicking outside the input box submits the entered velocity value.

8. **Bugs report and issues:**

  - If you enounter any bug or issues, please do tell
